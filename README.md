### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Yahaiii, I am a newbie developer and I am currently on the ALX Software Engineering programme working my way to become a full stack software engineer. I am excited about my journey and learning new things every day.

I have been practicing and experimenting with different languages such as C, Python and JavaScript. I am currently focused on mastering backend development with Node.js, Express and Postgres.

You can find my recent projects here on my profile, such as:
- A simple Image Processing API built with Sharp, an image processing module, and node.js
- A Storefront Backend app built with Postgres and Express
- A fully functional store built with Angular
- A personal portfolio website.

I am open to feedback and suggestions, so please feel free to reach out to me with any thoughts or ideas you may have. I am also open to working with others on new projects, and I am always excited to collaborate.

I will continue to update my profile as I grow and develop my skills, so please check back for new projects and updates.

In my free time, I like to practice and continue learning new technologies, and try to build new things.

Join my journey and let's learn together!
