### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Yahaiii, I am a newbie developer and I am currently on the ALX Software Engineering programme working my way to become a full stack software engineer. I am excited about my journey and learning new things every day.

You can find my recent projects here on my profile, such as:
- simple Image Processing API built with Sharp, an image processing module, and node.js
- fully functional store built with Angular
- personal portfolio website.

I am open to feedback and suggestions, so please feel free to reach out to me with any thoughts or ideas you may have. 

In my free time, I like to learn about AI.

Join my journey and let's learn together!
