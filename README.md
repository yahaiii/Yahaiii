### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Yahai. I recently completed the ALX Intro to Software Engineering Program and was thrilled to receive a nomination for Chief Encouragement Officer (CEO) of the cohort -- the expert motivator who can turn "I can't" into "I can". This recognition is a testament to the incredible support of the ALX community, my mentors, my fellow learners, and is a testament to the opportunities and growth that the ALX Intro to Software Engineering Program offers. #ALXSE #SoftwareEngineering #DoingHardThings

I'm currently working on honing my skills and building a portfolio of projects, including:

- A meeting scheduling app
- A coordinate extraction tool

I'm always open to feedback and suggestions, so please feel free to reach out with any thoughts or ideas you may have.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring the world of AI and staying up-to-date with the latest advancements in technology.


ðŸ“« Feel free to connect with me:
